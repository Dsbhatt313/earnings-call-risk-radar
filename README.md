# Earnings Call Risk Radar

A 3-stage pipeline that predicts stock risk from earnings call transcripts.

* Stage 1: FinBERT sentiment extraction
* Stage 2: XGBoost risk classifier
* Stage 3: RAG-based Q&A over transcripts (ChromaDB + Gemini)

Status: In development — Day 1 complete (data collection).

## Setup (work in progress)
Data sources: Kaggle Motley Fool earnings call transcripts + yfinance prices.
Full setup instructions coming at project completion.

## Datasets

- `data/processed/transcripts.csv` — Day 1 output. 274 deduplicated earnings-call transcripts
  across 30 tickers (Jun 2019 – Feb 2023). Treat as read-only.

- `data/processed/transcripts_v2.csv` — Day 2 cleaned modeling dataset. 273 transcripts.
  Drops WMT 2020-Q4, which was a mislabeled Walmart Investment Community Meeting
  (Investor Day, ~32k words) rather than a Q4 2020 earnings call. All downstream
  modeling (Days 3+) uses v2.

- `data/processed/features.csv` — Day 2 feature-engineered dataset.
  273 rows × 21 columns (3 IDs + 9 raw features + 9 per-ticker z-scores).
  Features: word_count, sentence_count, avg_sentence_length,
  flesch_kincaid_grade, numeric_density, negative_count, uncertainty_count,
  litigious_count, forward_looking_count.
  Lexicon source: Loughran-McDonald 1993-2025, with stop-list cleanup
  for call-format artifacts ("question/questions" in Negative;
  "whatever/whereas/notwithstanding/beneficial/ratable" in Litigious).
  Weak_Modal category dropped due to >90% overlap with Uncertainty.
