# Earnings Call Risk Radar

A 3-stage pipeline that predicts stock risk from earnings call transcripts.

* Stage 1: FinBERT sentiment extraction
* Stage 2: XGBoost risk classifier
* Stage 3: RAG-based Q&A over transcripts (ChromaDB + Gemini)

Status: In development — Day 1 complete (data collection).

## Setup (work in progress)
Data sources: Kaggle Motley Fool earnings call transcripts + yfinance prices.
Full setup instructions coming at project completion.

## Datasets

- `data/processed/transcripts.csv` — Day 1 output. 274 deduplicated earnings-call transcripts
  across 30 tickers (Jun 2019 – Feb 2023). Treat as read-only.

- `data/processed/transcripts_v2.csv` — Day 2 cleaned modeling dataset. 273 transcripts.
  Drops WMT 2020-Q4, which was a mislabeled Walmart Investment Community Meeting
  (Investor Day, ~32k words) rather than a Q4 2020 earnings call. All downstream
  modeling (Days 3+) uses v2.
